# GraphRAG Configuration Template: Financial Documents
# =====================================================
# Best for: Financial reports, earnings calls, SEC filings, market analysis
#
# Optimized for:
# - Extracting companies, metrics, financial figures
# - Temporal analysis (quarters, fiscal years)
# - Relationship mapping (acquisitions, partnerships)
#
# Usage:
#   cp templates/financial.toml ./graphrag.toml
#   # or: graphrag init --template financial
